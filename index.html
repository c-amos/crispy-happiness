    <h2 class="section-heading" id="characteristics-of-seawater">Characteristics of Seawater</h2>

    <p><b class="review-question">How does seawater differ from river water or even ‘pure’ water?</b></p>
    <p>Seawater differs from river water and "pure" water by virtue of its chemical composition. Seawater is characteristically higher in dissolved compounds of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl), as well as relatively low proportions of silica (Si) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>).</p>

    <p><b class="review-question">Describe the geometry, polarity, and inter-connectiveness of water molecules (i.e., both how ions are held together to form a single H2O molecule and how multiple H2O molecules are held together to form what we know of as water) and how these features give rise to some of the special properties of water, such as surface tension and its description as the universal solvent.</b></p>

    <p>Water molecules consist of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms (hence the name H<sub>2</sub>), and their molecular geometry is such that both of the hydrogen atoms gather together on one "side" of the oxygen molecule, leaving a bare half of the oxygen molecule on the other side.</p>

    <p>This geometry causes a positive charge on the "side" of the molecule with both of the hydrogen atoms on it, and the side with the bare half of the oxygen molecule is negatively charged. Therefore, the molecule can be described as "dipolar."</p>

    <p><b class="review-question">Can we derive seawater by mixing average stream/river water with pure water? Be able to explain how precipitation, evaporation, biological activity, & interaction between seawater and ocean crust near oceanic spreading centers (e.g., MOR) influence the composition of seawater (i.e., the sources and sinks controlling the budget of dissolved components in seawater).</b></p>

    <p>We cannot derive seawater purely by mixing average stream/river water with "pure" water because the ocean consists of biological organisms, oceanic crust, and biological/climatic processes that further affects the composition of dissolved solids in the water.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b class="review-question">Precipitation and evaporation</b> | These factors affect the composition of seawater, and particularly the distribution of solids across the entire ocean, because evaporated water and air masses interact with the temperature in such a way that cooler air masses dilute the water around tropical zones.</li>
      <li><b class="review-question">Biological activity</b> | This factor affects the composition of seawater because organisms (particularly silica-type and carbonate-type microorganisms) collect dissolved silica and calcium carbonate in the ocean to build protective "shells" for themselves (technically called "tests"). For this reason, silica and calcium carbonate in the ocean comes in decidedly low quantities.</li>
      <li><b class="review-question">Oceanic crust</b> | Oceanic crust affects the composition of seawater because the sediment is thinnest where the ocean floor is young along mid-ocean ridges.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b class="review-question">Is the salinity of the oceans constant? If not, how does it vary with latitude and with distance from continental margins? Explain why it varies with each of these factors/parameters/locations.</b></p>

    <p>The salinity of the oceans is not constant. Salinity (i.e. relative density of dissolved solids per unit of water) tends to fixate around areas where evaporation decidedly outweighs precipitation-- this phenomenon occurs near the equator and around Earth's poles where water evaporates in relatively hig quantities and the air masses containing the water vapor migrate <i>away</i> from these areas. In tropical zones, however, precipitation decidedly outweighs evaporation and the water becomes "diluted" (so as to say that the relative density of dissolved solids is decreased due to an inundation of "pure" water).</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading" id="classification-of-marine-sediments">Classification of Marine Sediments</h2>

    <p><b class="review-question">Many of the inputs & outputs for dissolved solids (from 1 above) correspond nicely with the way most marine sediments are typically classified: lithogenous (terrigenous), biogenous, and hydrogenous (+ cosmogenous). Define and give examples of each type. Which sediment type is most abundant?</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b class="review-question">Lithogenous/Terrigenous sediments</b> | These sediments are derived from oceanic and continental crust-- the stem <i>lithos</i> (Greek) indicates that these sediments come from rocks and crust. Examples might include sediments produced by weathering and erosion from landmasses and rock structures on the continent itself, or from crust formations of the oceanic crust.</li>
      <p>Terrigenous sediments make up around 75% of all marine sediments and are thus the most abundant type of sediment in the ocean.</p>

      <li><b class="review-question">Biogenous sediments</b> | These sediments are derived from biological processes in the ocean-- particularly and predominantly those of the silica-type and the carbonate-type microorganisms mentioned above. Examples include sediments produced from the residue of silica/carbonate tests, as well as macroscopic organisms bones, teeth, and shells.</li>
      <p>Biogenous sediments make up around 20% of all marine sediments.</p>

      <li><b class="review-question">Hydrogenous sediments</b> | These sediments are derived from the remains of evaporated water. Examples include phosphates and manganese nodules</li>
      <!-- <p>Hydrogenous sediments make up _% of all marine sediments.</p> -->

      <li><b class="review-question">Cosmogenous sediments</b> | These sediments are derived from interstellar dust and debris from meteorites.</li>
      <!-- <p>Cosmogenous sediments make up _% of all marine sediments.</p> -->
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-heading" id="terrigenous-sediments">Terrigenous (lithogenous) sediments</h2>

    <p><b class="review-question">Where are terrigenous marine sediments found? What are some of the key differences between terrigeneous sediment in neritic and pelagic environments?</b></p>

    <p>Terrigenous marine sediments are found at sites of weathering and erosion as well as the byproduct of volcanic eruptions. Key differences between neritic and pelagic sediments include the following:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Neritic</th>
        <th>Pelagic</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>More coarse</td>
        <td>Usually finer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Introduced by/as:
        <ul>
          <li>Wind-blown dust</li>
          <li>Turbidity currents</li>
        </ul></td>

        <td>
        Introduced by/as:
        <ul>
          <li>Wind-blown dust</li>
          <li>Volcanic eruptions</li>
        </ul></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p><b class="review-question">Where do most neritic sediments come from, both generally and specifically, and why?</b></p>

    <p>Most neritic sediments come from the erosion of rocks and continental margins because most neritic sediments are also terrigenous/lithogenous sediments. In particular, most of this sediment is composed of quartz gr</p>

    <p><b class="review-question">What are turbidity currents, where do they develop, and what are the sediment characteristics of turbidity deposits?</b></p>

    <p>Turbidity currents erode the continental margin and carry terrigenous sediments into the neritic zones of the ocean. The sediment characteristics of turbidity deposits are ...</p>

    <p><b class="review-question">How do fine-grained terrigenous sediments (i.e., abyssal clays) make it to pelagic environments?</b></p>

    <p>Fine-grained terrigenous sediments are distinct from more coarsely-grained sediments in part by their relatively lower weight. For this reason, the process of wind can sometimes collect small particles of wind-blown "dust" (i.e. these sediments) and deposit them further out into the pelagic reaches of the ocean.</p>

    <div class="quiz-review-section" id="section-four">
    <h2 class="section-heading" id="biogenous-sediments">Biogenous sediments</h2>

    <p><b class="review-question" id="sxn-four-qn-one">Are biogenous marine sediments dominantly macroscopic or microscopic? What is the most abundant type of macroscopic biogenous sediment? Where are examples of the most common macroscopic marine sediments?</b></p>

    <div class="review-response" id="sxn-four-resp-one">

    <p>Biogenous sediments are predominantly microscopic-- macroscopic sediments are considered more rare and particularly abundant around areas like the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

    <p>The most abundant type of <i>macroscopic</i> biogenous sediment comes from coral and their calcareous shells. Examples include coral reefs like the Great Barrier Reef and Heron Island.</p>

    </div>

    <p><b class="review-question">What is a coral, what is it comprised of? What are zooxanthellae and what is their role in a coral-reef community? What are the conditions required for reef-building corals?</b></p>

    <p>A coral is a  colony of <i>polyps</i> (i.e. multi-footed organisms), which a specific type of benthic marine animal that feeds, in part, by using stinging tentacles. You might think of a coral reef as a "colony" and each coral as a "subcolony" within the larger reef-- corals make "colonies" for themselves out of calcium carbonate for protection.</p>

    <p>Zooxanthellae are small algae that live in a mutualistic relationship with coral. They are photosynthetic organisms and, when attached to coral, provide them nourishment through their photosynthetic process, whihc provides coral their main source of nutrition despite otherwise being predatory organisms/consumers.</p>

    <p>Reef-building corals require the following six conditions in order to construct coral reefs:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Warm (18&degC - 28&degC) and shallow (less than 40m deep) water</li>
      <li>Sunlight (for algae)</li>
      <li>Salty water; far away from river inputs</li>
      <li>Relatively strong current and wave action to supply nutrients and dissolved gases/CO<sub>2</sub>.
      <li>Low turbidity, a.k.a. relatively clear water</li>
      <li>A substrate (i.e. flat-ish "land" area or foundation) to grow on</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b class="review-question">What are the two main types of microscopic biogenous sediments on the basis of composition? Be able to name or identify examples for each, including whether their associated organism is a producer or a consumer.</b></p>

    <p>The two main types of microscopic biogenous sediments are the <i>silica-based</i> and the <i>carbonate-based</i> sediments. These two main categories break off into phytoplankton and microscopic algae (producer) and zooplankton (consumer) subsets.</p>
    <p>For the silica category, an example of silica-variant microscopic algae is a group called <i>diatoms</i> (with shells made of silica), and an example of silica-variant zooplankton is a group called <i>radiolarians</i>.</p>
    <p>For the calcium carbonate category, an example of this variant of algae is a group called <i>coccoliths</i>, and <i>foraminifora</i> refers to an example of carbonate-variant consumers.</p>

    <p><b class="review-question">What controls the distribution of marine sedimentary deposits for each type (i.e., siliceous and calcareous oozes)?</b></p>

    <p>The distribution of marine sedimentary deposits depends primarily upon the depth of the water-- the reason why is because the water's depth has implications for the biological productivity and rate of dissolution of tests (algae shells) in seawater.</p>

    <p>Calcareous ooze is generally found at shallower depths (particularly near mid-ocean ridges) because dissolution of calcareous shells is lower in warmer water, whereas siliceous ooze is generally found at deeper depths because the siliceous tests dissolve much faster in warmer water.</p>
